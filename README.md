> *by Igor Trujnara, Anastasia Sukhorukova and Anna Chechenina*

In this repository you can find all materials related to the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction enery calculation project on Biophysics cousre 2022 at ESCI-UPF. 
The full script could be found in the project notebook and it contains few steps:
* clearing up the structure using [biobb structere checking library](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_structure_checking)
* calculation of the Van-der-Waals energy
* calculation of the Solvation energy
* calculation of the Electrostatic energy
* calculation of the total energy and Ala-scanning

You can also find the colab version of the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T3j6bO1l1tVWI1Rey6glZlItV7ECTI9s?usp=sharing).

In the *raw_data* folder you can find parameter files we used for calculations and library creation as well as raw and fixed structures.
